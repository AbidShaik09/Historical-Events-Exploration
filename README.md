## <a name="_puziflcfc3b9"></a>Identify Gap: 
In the pursuit of creating immersive AR experiences for historical event exploration, it's essential to recognize the existing gaps and challenges in the development process. Identifying these gaps helps in refining the approach and achieving more accurate, engaging, and historically faithful AR simulations. Here are some key gaps and areas of improvement in AR historical event exploration:

Historical Accuracy: One of the primary gaps is ensuring the highest level of historical accuracy. AR experiences must strive to faithfully represent historical events, settings, and characters. Bridging this gap involves meticulous research and collaboration with historians to validate historical details.

Content Diversity: AR historical event exploration often focuses on well-documented events and locations. Addressing this gap involves expanding the scope to include lesser-known historical events, cultures, and regions, allowing users to explore a broader range of historical contexts.

Interactivity: Many AR historical experiences lack meaningful interactivity beyond passive observation. Bridging this gap involves developing more interactive elements that allow users to make choices, influence outcomes, and actively engage with historical narratives.

Accessibility: AR technology can present accessibility challenges for users with disabilities. Developers should prioritize making AR historical experiences more inclusive by addressing issues related to mobility, visual impairments, and hearing impairments.

Realism and Immersion: Achieving a high level of realism and immersion is an ongoing challenge. Bridging this gap involves advancements in AR hardware, graphics, and physics simulations to create environments that feel truly immersive and lifelike.

Educational Integration: AR historical event exploration has significant potential in education. However, there is a gap in integrating AR experiences into formal educational curricula. Collaborations with educational institutions and educators can help bridge this divide.

User Experience Design: Crafting a seamless and user-friendly experience in AR historical exploration remains a challenge. Developers need to continuously refine user interfaces, navigation methods, and interaction mechanisms to enhance user comfort and engagement.

Hardware Accessibility: AR headsets and equipment can be expensive and require substantial computing power. Developers need to consider solutions to make AR more accessible to a broader audience, including those with lower-end hardware.

Narrative Storytelling: While AR provides a unique platform for storytelling, there is a gap in harnessing its full potential. Developing innovative narrative techniques specific to AR can enhance the storytelling aspect of historical exploration.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensuring AR experiences are compatible with various AR platforms and devices can be challenging. Developers should aim for cross-platform compatibility to reach a wider audience.

Feedback and Iteration: The iterative development process is essential for refining AR historical experiences. Bridging this gap requires feedback mechanisms that allow users to provide input and developers to implement improvements.

Historical Contextualization: Providing historical context within the AR experience is crucial for users to fully comprehend the significance of events. Bridging this gap involves integrating informative elements without overwhelming users.

## <a name="_gu9lmoq5h70o"></a>
## <a name="_p6z1ldevlzs0"></a>**Discussion:**
This study focuses on the realm of AR historical event exploration and delves into the intricate factors influencing user behavior in this context. The insights gleaned from this research offer valuable implications for the development and implementation of AR historical event exploration experiences. Here, we dissect the key findings and their repercussions:

Humanization and Immersion: The study underscores the observation that users tend to ascribe human-like attributes to their AR historical event exploration. This revelation carries substantial weight, implying that creating immersive, lifelike encounters where users feel as though they are actively participating in historical events can significantly enrich the overall user experience. Developers should strongly consider integrating anthropomorphic elements to bridge the divide between the virtual world and reality, thus fostering a heightened sense of presence.

Educational Significance: A pivotal finding lies in the educational potential of AR historical event exploration. When users can engage with historical events as though they are genuine participants, AR becomes a potent tool for facilitating learning experiences. Educators and content creators should take heed of this and explore avenues for seamlessly integrating AR historical exploration into educational frameworks.

User Engagement at the Core: Central to user compliance is the concept of social presence. When users experience a profound sense of presence within the historical context, their inclination to actively engage with the narrative is heightened. This signifies that AR experiences should prioritize user engagement by offering avenues for interaction, decision-making, and exploration.

Consistency and Self-Identity: The research uncovers an intriguing aspect regarding the FITD technique—namely, its impact is not directly influenced by social presence. Instead, user compliance within AR experiences appears to be more rooted in their desire for self-consistency rather than their perception of social presence. This underscores the critical importance of crafting experiences that align with users' self-identity and values.

Influence of the Requester: While the study primarily focuses on user compliance, it hints at the potential influence wielded by the requester or guide within AR historical events. This opens up avenues for further exploration into how users perceive and respond to historical figures or guides, shedding light on their impact on user engagement and compliance.

Interdisciplinary Synergy: AR historical event exploration exists at the crossroads of technology, history, education, and psychology. The study accentuates the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration to create comprehensive and effective experiences. Historians, educators, psychologists, and AR developers should synergize their efforts to ensure historical accuracy, educational value, and user engagement.

Ethical Deliberations: As AR historical event exploration progresses towards heightened immersion, ethical considerations come to the forefront. It is imperative to ensure that users have responsible and respectful experiences while interacting with historical events and figures, underscoring the need for ethical guidelines and considerations.
